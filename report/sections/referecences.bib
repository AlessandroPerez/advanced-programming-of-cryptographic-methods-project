abstract = {This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) as a Transport Layer Security (TLS) authenticated encryption operation.  GCM provides both confidentiality and data origin authentication, can be efficiently implemented in hardware for speeds of 10 gigabits per second and above, and is also well-suited to software implementations.  This memo defines TLS cipher suites that use AES-GCM with RSA, DSA, and Diffie-Hellman-based key exchange mechanisms. [STANDARDS-TRACK]}

abstract = {The X3DH protocols is a key agreement protocol that is used in the Signal protocol to establish a shared secret key between two parties. While there is a rigorous security analysis for the Signal protocol, the X3DH protocol does not have the same level of analysis. In this paper we will provide such an analysis and provide explanations for most of the theory that is used. We will define the security this protocol gives and give a proof of security of the X3DH protocol by using game hops and introducing an adversary with power over the network and proving a bound on the advantage of the adversary. The conclusion is that the X3DH protocol provides secrecy of the shared secret and the message}

howpublished = {\url{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7961996}},
abstract = {Signal is a new security protocol and ac- companying app that provides end-to-end encryption for instant messaging. The core protocol has recently been adopted by WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Google Allo among many others; the first two of these have at least 1 billion active users. Signal includes several uncommon security properties (such as “future secrecy” or “post-compromise security”), enabled by a novel technique called ratcheting in which session keys are updated with every message sent. Despite its importance and novelty, there has been little to no academic analysis of the Signal protocol. We conduct the first security analysis of Signal’s Key Agreement and Double Ratchet as a multi-stage key exchange protocol. We extract from the implementation a formal description of the abstract protocol, and define a security model which can capture the “ratcheting” key update structure. We then prove the security of Signal’s core in our model, demonstrating several standard se- curity properties. We have found no major flaws in the design, and hope that our presentation and results can serve as a starting point for other analyses of this widely adopted protocol.}
